#Eye of the Tiger: A  Study of Artificial Life
##Student Symposium Presentation 
###Shannon Bolton and Nikki Pruitt
###Presentation Date: February 17, 2016

##Abstract
Can computers simulate how creatures evolve over time? Using NetLogo, we will simulate how “rabbits” evolve over time to ensure the best offspring survive. The rabbits will each feature a cone of vision. These vision cones all have the same area, but different distances from their body. The rabbits will need to collect water and hunt one another to survive. There will also be other environmental variables that can potentially affect the rabbits. Through the simulation, we can see whether a longer or shorter cone of vision would be more beneficial for survival.
